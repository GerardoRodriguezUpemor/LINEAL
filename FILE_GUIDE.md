## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Run Your ML Library (2 minutes)
```bash
cd "c:\Users\gera_\Desktop\LINEAL"
java -cp target/classes org.upemor.personal.lineal.LINEAL
```

### 2. Study the Output (10 minutes)
- Vector norms demonstration (your formula: ||x||_p)
- Linear regression training and prediction
- Logistic regression classification  
- Gradient descent optimization

### 3. Read the Journey Guide (30 minutes)
Open `README_COMPLETE_JOURNEY.md` for your complete roadmap.

### 4. Start Learning (Lifetime)
Follow the 17-week curriculum in `ML_LEARNING_PATH.md`.
