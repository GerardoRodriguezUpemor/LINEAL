### 🎯 Your Mathematical Formula Implementation
**Your LINEAL program successfully implements the exact formula from your image:**
$$||x||_p := \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i|^p\right)^{1/p}$$

When you ran the program, you saw:
```
Vector: [3.0, -4.0, 0.0, 5.0]
L1 Norm (Manhattan): 12.000
L2 Norm (Euclidean): 7.071
L∞ Norm (Maximum): 5.000
```

This connects directly to:
- **L1 regularization** in Lasso regression (sparsity)
- **L2 regularization** in Ridge regression (smoothness)  
- **Distance metrics** in clustering and classification
